## Project Overview
In todayâ€™s data-driven business environment, organizations rely heavily on insights to improve performance. This project uses SQL to analyze a simulated retail dataset and uncover patterns that influence profitability and customer behavior.

## Project Scope & Business Objective
**Scope of the Analysis**  
This SQL-based project focuses on answering three critical business questions:  
- Which products generate the highest profit?  
- Which regions contribute the most to sales and profit?  
- Which customer segments are the most profitable?

**Business Objectives**
The goal is to transform raw sales data into strategic insights that:  
- Support inventory planning by focusing on profitable products.  
- Guide market expansion by identifying strong-performing regions.  
- Improve customer retention strategies by targeting high-value customer segments.  

These insights help businesses refine sales models, marketing strategies, and overall financial performance.

## Use Case & Data Source

**Use Case:**
- Helps retail analysts and business teams make data-informed decisions
- Demonstrates practical SQL skills: data extraction, transformation, and insight generation

**Data Source:**
- Dataset: Superstore Dataset (publicly available on Kaggle)
- Format: CSV
- Content: Transactional retail data including sales, profit, customer, and regional fields    

The dataset mirrors real world sales performance, making it ideal for practical analysis.
